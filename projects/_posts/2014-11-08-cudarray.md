title: CUDArray - CUDA-based NumPy
image: /images/cudarray.png
excerpt: CUDArray is a CUDA-accelerated subset of the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library. The goal of CUDArray is to combine the easy of development from the NumPy with the computational power of Nvidia GPUs in a lightweight and extensible framework.

Python/NumPy is great for numerical computing!
For larger neural networks, however, GPU accelerated array operations are needed for decent run times.
CUDArray tries to combine the easy of development from the NumPy with the computational power of Nvidia GPUs in a lightweight and extensible framework.
While CUDArray only implements a small subset of NumPy it is mature enough to support a neural network pipeline as demonstrated in the [deeppy](http://github.com/andersbll/deeppy/) project.
